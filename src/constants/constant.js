          answer:
            "With electronics visa process, you do not have to visit the Myanmar Embassy to apply for a visa. No submission of documents is required during the application process because the E-visa process from application to approval is completely done online. The process is very straight forward; the applicants just need to fill out the details and submit the payment through a secure payment gateway with a credit card.After successful submission of the application, the applicant will get an acknowledgement letter stating that the visa application process is successful. Within 10 days, visa approval letter will be sent to the applicant through email. The visitor needs t0 out the letter and bring along with a passport to a designated airport. By using electronic visa application, visa application process is a lot easier. Extra time and money could be saved through this process and there is no more hassle with the documents.",
